        <h2>I. Detailed Shipping and Order Fulfillment</h2>
        <p>We fulfill Nigerian orders within **3 to 5 business days**, as all items are **made-to-order**. We currently do not offer international shipping or delivery outside of Nigeria.</p>
        <p>Once your item is ready, we will contact you to confirm your preferred courier or a local pickup arrangement within Nigeria. Delivery costs are separate from the item price and will be communicated once your order is ready; **you pay the courier directly**. Customers may choose their own preferred courier.</p>
        <p>For customers located in Lagos, a **local pickup option is available at no extra cost**; pickup details are shared once the order is ready. This approach ensures your personalized items arrive on time and in perfect condition.</p>

        <h2>II. Pricing, Payment, and Ordering Process Details</h2>

        <p>Receiving an order confirmation email means we have received your order and are preparing to process it, but it does not yet constitute **order acceptance**.</p>

    <section id="returns">
        <h2>III. Detailed Terms, Returns, and Liability</h2>
        <p>Our policy is that all sales of **non-damaged products are final and non-refundable**; returns are only accepted if the product arrives damaged. Due to the custom, made-to-order nature of our items, we cannot accept returns for buyer's remorse or sizing issues.</p>
        <p>If the product is damaged upon arrival, you must reach out to us **within 7 days of delivery** and may be asked to fill out a return form at <a href="https://iamxis.com.ng/return-form/">https://iamxis.com.ng/return-form/</a>.</p>
        <p>Refunds are processed only after the returned damaged item has been received and checked by our team. If an exchange requires a second delivery, the customer is responsible for covering the additional delivery cost.</p>
        <p>All content, trademarks, and logos on the website are protected by **I AM XIS intellectual property**. These terms of purchase are governed exclusively by **Nigerian law**, and disputes are handled by Nigerian courts.</p>

    <section id="personalization">
        <h2>IV. Personalization and Design File Requirements</h2>
        <p>We accept high-resolution files in **PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, or PDF** format. Every detail matters, so files must be clear, high-quality, and not blurry.</p>
        <p>For the best print results, files should have a minimum of **300 DPI**. Avoid screenshots or small, pixelated images. We use a standard **CMYK color profile**.</p>
        <p>If sending designs via WhatsApp, please send the file as a **document, not a photo**, to maintain full quality.</p>

        <h3>Print Sizes and File Limits:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Tees:** Sizes range from A5 Mini (5" x 8") to A2 Max (16" x 23").</li>
            <li>**Totes:** The print size is A4 Mid (8" x 11").</li>
            <li>You can upload at least **three files per order**, with each file under **10MB**.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Placement and Changes:</h3>
        <p>If you have a specific design placement (front, center, corner), please let us know by adding a note during checkout or uploading a reference image. Clear file naming (e.g., "front tote image.png") is essential for accurate placement.</p>
        <p>Once an order is placed and the design file is confirmed, **changes cannot be made after a strict 6-hour window**, as our production process begins shortly thereafter.</p>
        <p>We cannot guarantee exact color matches due to variations in monitor settings and material absorption rates. If you are unsure about your file quality, please reach out to us for assistance via our Contact Form, WhatsApp, Call, SMS at **+234 708 005 4074**, or Email at **hello@iamxis.com.ng**.</p>
